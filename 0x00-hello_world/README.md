# 0x00-hello_world

This folder contains the introductory project for the ALX Low Level Programming repository. The focus of this project is to get familiar with the basics of the C programming language, including compilation and execution of C programs.

## Project Tasks

1. **0-preprocessor**
   - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

2. **1-compiler**
   - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.

3. **2-assembler**
   - A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

4. **3-name**
   - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

5. **4-puts.c**
   - A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle followed by a new line.

6. **5-printf.c**
   - A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, followed by a new line.

7. **6-size.c**
   - A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## How to Use

To run each task, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x00-hello_world` directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world
   ```

2. For each task, there is a corresponding C file. To compile and run a task, use the GCC compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   gcc -o 0-preprocessor 0-preprocessor.c
   ./0-preprocessor
   ```

   Replace `0-preprocessor` and `0-preprocessor.c` with the appropriate task name and C file.

3. Follow the instructions in the task to complete it.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of C programming.

Happy coding!
